            "Academics Are Cool" began in the spring of 1996 when Gregg 
            Sampson, a mathematics teacher at Lewis & Clark High School 
            (LCHS) in Spokane, Washington organized a mathematics 
            competition for sixth grade students in the Spokane area. 
            He and members of the LCHS Math Team organized the events, 
            wrote the competition items and implemented the competition 
            at LCHS.

              expanded to grades 4-12 with grade level competitions held 
              on six dates throughout the school year at LCHS. During the 
              same school year, Triscia Hochstatter, a mathematics teacher 
              at Moses Lake High School (MLHS), organized a grade four and 
              five combined "Math Is Cool" competition in Moses Lake, adding
