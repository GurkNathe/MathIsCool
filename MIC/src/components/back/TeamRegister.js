            <b>Rules for Individuals:</b> Any student may compete as an individual 
            in their grade level or any higher grade; however, a student may 
            compete as a team at one grade level only. This applies to both 
            Championships and Masters.<br/>

            Also note each team includes four students in addition to 
            two alternates per school that can compete as individuals. So 
            when registering n teams , you get to bring 4n+2 students along. 
            These students don't need to be registered as individuals separately.
